# - This class fixes rate-limit renaming problems
# - Previously if a channel were to be updated 3 times in a row (user playing word -> launcher -> game)
# - (depending on timing) Channel could be rate-limited and the channel is renamed word then rate limited,
# renamed launcher then limited and finally game after far too long.
# - This class should prevent old rate-limited names from being applied if a more recent up-to-date name is preferable
# - To use this, use: await bot.renamer.schedule(temp_channel, new_name) instead of: await temp_channel.edit(name=new_name)
